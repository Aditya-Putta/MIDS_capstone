Readme:

Navigate to the root directory (WebApp) and run using ‘python run.py’ at the command line. Runs on Python 3.5, probably Python 2 compatible.

You will need to install flask and WTForm

To plug in back end, you will only need to modify the ‘run_model()’ function in app/views.py.

Flask runs on local host port 8080 for now; I will run it publicly over a unicorn server once we have hooked in our data.
